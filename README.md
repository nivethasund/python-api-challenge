## WeatherPy & VacationPy

In this assignment, I use my knowledge of APIs to analyze data extracted from the OpenWeatherApp and citipy (a geo-location library embedded in Python) to observe weather conditions in a given range of cities. With that information, I've also identified the nearest hotels to cities that match my ideal weather conditions.

Please note that the images of my VacationPy maps, plotted with hvplot, do not appear in the notebook preview on GitHub. So for ease of viewing, I've dropped screenshots of my results below
