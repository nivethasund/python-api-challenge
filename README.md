## WeatherPy & VacationPy

In this assignment, I use my knowledge of APIs to analyze data extracted from the OpenWeatherApp and citipy (a geo-location library embedded in Python) to observe weather conditions in a given range of cities. With that information, I've also identified the nearest hotels to cities that match my ideal weather conditions.

I've also included my analysis of the Linear Regression plots for weather conditions across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, which can be found in the WeatherPy notebook.

Please note that the images of my VacationPy maps, plotted with hvplot, do not appear in the notebook preview on GitHub. So for ease of viewing, I've dropped screenshots of my results below.

There were no additional sources used during the process of completing this assignment. The information and code learnt during class was sufficient.
